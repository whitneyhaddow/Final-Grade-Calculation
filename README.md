Final-Grade-Calculation
=======================

Simple application to calculate final grade for a student based on the grades for various components of the course.

First version (Lab 2) processes student's grades based on 3 quizzes, a midterm, and a final exam.
The lowest of the quiz marks is dropped and the remainin 2 are each worth 15 percent of total grade.
The midterm and final are worth 30 and 40 percent of grade, respectively.

Second verison (Lab 4) improves on the application by allowing up to 10 possible quiz grades stored in an array.
Again, the lowest quiz is dropped. All remaining quizzes are averaged to equal 30 percent of final grade.
Data validation included.
